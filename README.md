Born in 2003 and currently in my second year as a software development student, with a strong focus on game development since spring 2025.

While I’m now learning more about 3D and VR game development, I’ve mostly worked on 2D games up to this point. Feel free to explore my [Itch](https://redreeh.itch.io/) for a closer look at my projects and possibly devlogs ✦

I also enjoy creating my own game assets, which I occasionally share on my [Itch](https://redreeh.itch.io/) page.ᐟ.ᐟ I mainly use Aseprite, and I am currently experimenting with MagicaVoxel and Blender.
